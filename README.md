# Twitter Clone

## Description
For this project we need to create a clone of the [Twitter](https://twitter.com) website.
Rails is used to create the frontend and the backend because we can have an MVP fast and easy.


## Run the app

```bash
$ git clone project
$ maildev --web 1080 --smtp 1025 --hide-extensions STARTTLS
$ rails server
```

Go on http://localhost:1080/ to access maildev app to validate your registration.
